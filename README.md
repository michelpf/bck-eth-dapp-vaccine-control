# DApp Vaccine Control
Vaccine Control DApp based on Ethereum Blockchain

## Introduction

This is a proof-of-concept project to explain how Smart Contracts works on Ethereum blockchain platform.
The main goal is to create a registration control for vaccines under blockchain to enable more control and allow third party solutions to get updated information without paper dependencies.

## Utilization

The main screen will show the first and last name connected to the current digital wallet and related vaccines registered. This wallet usually supported by Metamask.

For new users and vaccine updates, first you need to click on "Create or change person identification".
